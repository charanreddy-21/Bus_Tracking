Bus Tracker Web Application

This project is a real-time bus tracking web application developed as part of a college mini project. The aim of this project is to help users track the live location of buses on a map while the driver shares location data during the journey.

The application has two sides: Driver side and User side.
On the driver side, the driver logs in, selects the start and end points, and starts the ride. Once the ride starts, the driver’s live GPS location is captured continuously and sent to the backend at regular intervals.

On the user side, users can view the live location of buses on an interactive map. The bus location updates automatically without refreshing the page. When the ride ends, the bus is removed from the map.

The backend stores and manages location data using files and JSON format. The project focuses on using basic data structures to efficiently store, update, and retrieve live bus location information.
